abstract: "This project investigates the application of reinforcement learning
techniques to the segmentation of medical images. In particular, we present a
novel approach that is based on learning how to grow a selection with
regions obtained from an image partition forest (IPF) based on various
attributes of the regions. Our algorithm will be almost automatic, although we
discuss why it cannot be classed as entirely automatic.
<br />
We then proceed to quantitatively evaluate this method against two datasets
of manually segmented femurs in MRI scans of knees and compare its
performance to that of state-of-the-art algorithms. We also discuss advantages
that our approach provides, such as achieving results in a much shorter
time and with significantly less expensive data labelling."

<br />
We develop a technique to evaluate the faulttolerance of a multi-agent system whose number
of agents is unknown at design time. We present
a method for injecting a variety of non-ideal behaviours, or faults, studied in the safety-analysis
literature into the abstract agent templates that are
used to generate an unbounded family of multiagent systems with different sizes. We define the
parameterised fault-tolerance problem as the decision problem of establishing whether any concrete system, in which the ratio of faulty versus
non-faulty agents is under a given threshold, satisfies a given temporal-epistemic specification. We
put forward a sound and complete technique for
solving the problem for the semantical set-up considered. We present an implementation and a case
study identifying the threshold under which the alpha swarm aggregation algorithm is robust to faults
against its temporal-epistemic specifications"

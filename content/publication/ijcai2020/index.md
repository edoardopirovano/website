abstract: "We present a method for reasoning about fault-tolerance in
unbounded robotic swarms. We introduce a novel semantics that accounts
for the probabilistic nature of both the swarm and possible
malfunctions, as well as the unbounded nature of swarms systems. We
define and interpret a variant of probabilistic linear-time temporal
logic on the resulting executions, including those resulting from
faulty behaviour by some of the agents in the swarm. We introduce the
decision problem of parameterised fault-tolerance, which concerns
determining whether a probabilistic specification holds under possibly
faulty behaviour. We introduce a procedure that we implement and use to
study a foraging protocol from swarm robotics, and report the experimental
results obtained.
"

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We extend our previous work on verifying probabilistic
multi-agent systems to also handle faults in the system."

abstract: "We introduce agent-environment systems where the agent
is stateful and executing a ReLU recurrent neural network.
We define and study their verification problem by providing
equivalences of recurrent and feed-forward neural networks
on bounded execution traces. We give a sound and complete
procedure for their verification against properties specified
in a simplified version of LTL on bounded executions. We
present an implementation and discuss the experimental results obtained."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We extend our previous work on verifying agent-environment systems
with an agent executing a ReLU-based controller to handle RNNs."

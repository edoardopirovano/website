abstract: "We present a framework for verifying strategic behaviour in an
unbounded multi-agent system. We introduce a novel probabilistic
semantics for parameterised multi-agent systems and define the
corresponding verification problem against two probabilistic variants
of alternating-time temporal logic. We define a verification procedure
using an abstract model construction. We show that the
procedure is complete for one variant of our specification language,
and partial for the other. We present an implementation and report
experimental results.
"

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We extend our previous work on verifying probabilistic
multi-agent systems to also handle strategic properties."

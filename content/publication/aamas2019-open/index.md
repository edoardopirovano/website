abstract: "We study open multi-agent systems in which countably many
agents may leave and join the system at run-time. We introduce a
semantics, based on interpreted systems, to capture the openness of
the system and show how an indexed variant of temporal-epistemic
logic can be used to express specifications on them. We define the
verification problem and show it is undecidable.
We isolate one decidable class of open multi-agent systems and give a partial decision
procedure for another one. We introduce MCMAS-OP, an open-source
toolkit implementing the verification procedures. We present the
results obtained using our tool on two examples."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We introduce a semantics to reason about MAS
in which an arbitrarily large number of agents may
join and leave at run-time."

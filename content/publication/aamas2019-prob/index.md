abstract: "We introduce a method for formally verifying properties of arbitrarily
large swarms whose agents are modelled probabilistically.
We define a parameterised probabilistic semantics for modelling
swarms and observe that their verification problem against PLTL
specifications is undecidable. We develop a partial procedure for
verifying arbitrarily large swarms based on counter abstraction and
show its correctness. We present an implementation and report the
experimental results obtained when verifying a swarm foraging
protocol."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We study a semantics, based on PLTL, for reasoning about the behaviour of an
unboundedly large number of probabilistic agents."
